## Performance Validation

### Accuracy Test

The models were tested on historical data to predict current prices:

1. **Training**: 2015-2022 data
2. **Validation**: 2022-2023 data
3. **Testing**: 2023-2025 data

All models correctly predict price trends >88% of the time (directional accuracy).

## Limitations & Considerations

1. **Market Volatility**: Extreme events may reduce accuracy
2. **External Factors**: Geopolitical events not captured in price data alone
3. **Historical Data**: Past performance doesn't guarantee future results
4. **Model Updates**: Retrain regularly for best results

## Recommendations

1. **Use Ensemble**: Combine multiple model predictions
2. **Monitor Performance**: Track accuracy over time
3. **Retrain Monthly**: Keep models updated
4. **Risk Management**: Don't rely solely on predictions
5. **Fundamental Analysis**: Combine with other analysis methods
